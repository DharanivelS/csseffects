            <p>The Sky-Dweller’s fluted, rotatable bezel is much more than an aesthetic feature. It allows the wearer to select the functions
               to be set – date, month, local time or reference time – by simply turning the bezel. Its slightly larger and deeper fluting differs from 
               the one manufactured for other Rolex watches, and offers an excellent grip when setting the Sky-Dweller.It, therefore, plays an essential 
               functional role, as was the case with the original Rolex Oyster. On that model, launched in 1926, the fluting served to screw the bezel 
               down onto the case to ensure the waterproofness of the watch. The Sky-Dweller’s fluted, rotatable bezel is much more than
